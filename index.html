      Mr. Iyengar was credited with bringing yoga to the west when he
      encountered a world-class violinist named Yehudi Menuhin. Mr. Menuhin
      became a student and a close friend of Mr. Iyengar and invited him to
      visit Europe and teach yoga in 1954. With Yehudi Menuhinâ€™s encouragement,
      Mr. Iyengar began to introduce people outside India to yoga's art and
      science. In 1956, Mr. Iyengar first taught yoga in the United States in
      Ann Arbor, Michigan. Throughout his life, Mr. Iyengar taught yoga all over
      the world.
